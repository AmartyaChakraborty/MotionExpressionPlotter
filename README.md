# MotionExpressionPlotter
MotionExpressionPlotter is a Python code repository that provides a convenient way to convert and plot mathematical expressions related to motion. The code allows you to easily convert between acceleration (a(t)), velocity (v(t)), and position (x(t)) functions, and visualize them using matplotlib.
MotionExpressionPlotter is a tool designed to simplify the conversion and visualization of mathematical expressions related to motion. It offers an intuitive interface to convert functions between acceleration, velocity, and position, allowing users to easily explore the relationships between these fundamental concepts.

By leveraging the power of SymPy, the code performs differentiation and integration operations to convert the functions accurately. The resulting expressions can then be plotted using matplotlib, providing users with a graphical representation of the motion expressions.

Whether you are a student studying kinematics, a researcher analyzing motion data, or simply curious about the behavior of different motion functions, MotionExpressionPlotter can aid in your understanding by enabling quick conversions and visualizations.

How to Use:
Clone the repository to your local machine or download the code files.
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed, including numpy and matplotlib.
Import the necessary libraries in your Python script or Jupyter Notebook.
se the convert_function() function to convert the desired motion expression. This function will prompt you to select the type of function you want to convert (a(t), v(t), or x(t)) and enter the corresponding function.

Once the conversion is performed, you will be prompted to select the type of function you want to plot (a(t), v(t), or x(t)). The code will then generate a plot of the selected function.

The plot will be displayed using matplotlib, allowing you to visualize the motion expression
